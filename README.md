# Data-Pipelines-using-LLM
This project automates data pipeline creation using Large Language Models (LLMs). The user provides a natural language request, and the LLM automatically generates and deploys the full ETL workflow: extracting data from an API, transforming it, and loading. The goal is to drastically simplify data management and accelerate development.
